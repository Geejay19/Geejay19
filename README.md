# 👋 Hi, I'm **Geethika Jayasekara**

## **Software Engineering Student | Electrical & Electronic Engineer**

#### Interested in:
### **Embedded Systems | Firmware | Digital Design | ASIC | Software Engineering**

I’m an engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in **Electrical & Electronic Engineering** and currently studying **Software Engineering** at *Tampere University of Applied Sciences, Finland*.  
My passion lies at the intersection of **embedded systems & software development**, **firmware development**, **digital design**, and **ASIC/FPGA workflows** — and I’m continuously expanding my skills into **software development** to become a well‑rounded engineer.

I enjoy building systems that blend hardware and software, and I’m actively looking to contribute to **embedded system development**, **firmware projects**, and **digital design/ASIC-related work** to gain deeper hands‑on experience while contributing meaningfully to real projects.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 **ASIC Flow with Synopsys Tools**  
Complete RTL‑to‑GDSII flow using SAED 32nm library  
Synthesis, PnR, timing, area & power analysis  
👉 [View Repository](https://github.com/Geejay19/ASIC-flow-with-Synopsys-Tools)

### 🔹**Digital Safe Lock Design Using SystemVerilog**
Designed to authenticate a 4‑bit security code using a combination of:
  - AXI‑style Parallel‑to‑Serial (P2S) data conversion
  - Finite State Machines (FSMs) — both Mealy and Moore versions
  - Bit‑by‑bit verification logic
  - Unlock/Incorrect signaling
    
👉 [View Repository](https://github.com/Geejay19/digital-safe-clock)

### 🔹**Mini Calculator Using SystemVerilog**
A simple FPGA‑based mini calculator designed to multiply two single‑digit numbers (0–9) and display the result on a dual 7‑segment display.
The design flow follows a structured hardware‑design approach:
  - Building basic arithmetic blocks (1‑bit and 8‑bit adders)
  - Constructing a 4‑bit multiplier using ripple‑carry adders
  - Designing a 7‑segment decoder for display output
  - Integrating all modules into a complete top‑level calculator system.
